  The BLOCKCHAIN is an immutable distributed ledger. A ledger is a collection of financial accounts or transactions and distributed means that the system is not controlled locally by a single part, it is running in fact in thousands of ordinary people, that have a copy of this network, all over the world and they are called independent nodes. With such attributes, this tech can be useful for many areas of the economy.

  This PROJECT is following the course https://www.udemy.com/share/101XSGBEESdlpVQHQ=/. It aims to build a Blockchain behavior with Javascript, so it will perform proof of work, create new blocks through the mining process, create new immutable transactions, validate the Blockchain's data. Code a decentralized Blockchain network capable to interact with the Internet through an API is the main objective. Another key characteristic is a consensus algorithm to secure that data is legitimate and synchronized. <br>
  Didactically speaking, the course objectifies to promote a good understanding of Blockchain technology and its mechanism.
