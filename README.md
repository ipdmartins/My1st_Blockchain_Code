  In concept, BLOCKCHAIN is an immutable distributed ledger. A ledger is a collection of financial accounts or transactions and distributed means that the system is not controlled locally by a single part. It might be run by thousands of ordinary people all over the world because they can have a copy of this network, and they are called independent nodes. These attributes make this tech useful for many areas of the economy.

  This project is following the course https://www.udemy.com/share/101XSGBEESdlpVQHQ=/. It aims to build a Blockchain behavior with Javascript, so it will perform proof of work, create new blocks through the mining process, create new immutable transactions, and validate the Blockchain's data. The code is a decentralized Blockchain network capable to interact with the Internet through an API. Another key characteristic is a consensus algorithm to secure that data is legitimate and synchronized. <br>
  Didactically speaking, the course objectifies to promote a good understanding of Blockchain technology and its mechanism.
